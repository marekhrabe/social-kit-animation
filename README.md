## E-mail Newsletter

This is a ton of JavaScript and CSS3 together. How to get all that into e-mail newsletter where <tables> are the holy grail? 

I actually made a screencast of final animation in my Chrome, took frames from the video and put them into PhotoShop's timeline. Then I masked background out of it and finally tweaked some timing of frames and it was done. It seems pretty simple, but it took some time to get the animation just right.
